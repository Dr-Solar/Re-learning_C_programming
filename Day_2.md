Hello everyone to my day 2 of C programming (not actually second day if u consider date) .

Today lets start with a link for a compiler which shows the **stack** or **memory area** of the processor -**https://pythontutor.com/render.html#mode=display**. This will be of help while **debugging** the code or program.


Okay lets jump onto main topic today i learned more about functions and loops, with that information I'm trying to get the sum of first ten natural numbers . Though this might sound simple but for me it was a new experience.The loop i used was "goto" loop and also if condition as well.
