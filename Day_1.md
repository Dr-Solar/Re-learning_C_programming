Day 1 is simple example of addition property.
I utilized addition property,next line,scanf and printf functions,and the usual header file #include<stdio.h> for identification of funtions and int for declaration of variables,return 0 to end the program.
I used all of these to create a multiplication table for whatever number i enter in input side.
Thank you.
