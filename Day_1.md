Day 1 is simple example of addition property.

I utilized "addition" property,"next line"\n,"scanf" and "printf" functions,and the usual "header file" #include<stdio.h> for identification of funtions and int for "declaration of variables",return 0 to end the program.

I used all of these to create a multiplication table for whatever number i enter in input side.

After listening to the class again i understood the same multiplication can be written using even less lines of code if i use a if loop.
So Day 1.1 is me using a "if loop" to shorten it.

In this i use a if loop and tried to use the logic that i need to add these number to itself 10 times
but i only know how a<something conndition so i tried a funny logic as condition 
if b<10 times a then the loop will repeat until b=a*10.
i used goto to return to the loop starting.

Thank you.
